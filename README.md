# source
Since I am unable to use Wikis, this will provide sources for the different projects (for the time being)

This will only provide certain blocks used on the different discord projects I run, such as:
1. QNix.py
2. Lisa.js

This is not a complete source for the projects. 

For a complete documentation for:
1. [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
2. [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
3. [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
